# MySQL
A Collection of notes and snippets on my journey of learning MySQL and refreshing myself on SQL in general! This is going alongside the 100 days of code I have committed myself too as well!

### Collection

This will be collection of notes taken in Markdown as that is my preferred interface
when dealing with notes virtually. These notes will be of what I find important and interesting and probably will not included many SQL snippets or code.

This is mainly to understand theory and instructions of ideas.

Thanks!
